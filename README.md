### Future Feature

1. Filters could be added to the page, for example, filter by 10 or filter by 20 and so on.
2. When you search for people, it searches through the whole database of 82 people. It could be limited to the number of people that appear on the page.

3. Header and footer can be added.


### My Idea

1. Each person's profile picture was supposed to be rounded. I made it in this shape because I thought it looked nicer than round.

2. Images for people and homeworlds were not available in SWAPI (https://swapi.dev/), so I used images from Unsplash (https://unsplash.com/). It's the same image for all people and their home world. I've added the dynamic alt tag for images that will change in relation to both the planet and the homeworld.

### Shahid's Story

I believe I put a lot of work into creating this project in the allotted time. Seven days ago, I had no idea what VUE was. I had no idea what the terms export default, v-if, and v-for meant, but now I am able to finish an entire project in seven days.
